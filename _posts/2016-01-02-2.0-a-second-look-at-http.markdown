We have seen that REST uses HTTP for data communication as browsers do. Virtually everything we will be doing with REST will be through HTTP. It is therefore important we take a closer look at HTTP itself.

HTTP is one of the protocols for data communication on the internet. It enables data transmission in a request-response pattern. The client sends a request for a resource to the server. The server in turn replies with a response. When you type a web address in a browser (client), that is basically what happens - the browser sends a request for the webpage and the server sends a response with the page’s content.

An HTTP message (request or response) has the format:

- An initial line
- Zero or more header lines
- A blank line, and
- An optional message body

Let’s look at both message types.
